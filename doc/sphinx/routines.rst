List of routines
================

You can generate the list and the description of the MPIFX routines via doxygen
(see folder `doc/doxygen/` in the source tree) or watch them in the `Online API
documentation <https://aradi.bitbucket.org/mpifx/api/annotated.html>`_. Look
for the detailed descriptions of the interfaces for examples.
