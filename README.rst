MPIFX - Modern Fortran Interface for MPI
========================================

The open source library `MPIFX <https://www.bitbucket.org/aradi/mpifx>`_ is
an effort to provide modern Fortran (Fortran 2003) wrappers around
routines of the MPI library to make their use as simple as possible.

A few essential communication routines are already covered. See the
documentation or the `online API DOCUMENTATION
<https://aradi.bitbucket.org/mpifx/api/annotated.html>`_ whether the routines
you need are there. If not, you are cordially invited to extend MPIFX and to
share it in order to let others profit from your work. MPIFX is licensed under
the **simplified BSD license**.

Information about installation and usage of the library you find in the
documentation in the source or in the `online documentation
<https://aradi.bitbucket.org/mpifx/>`_. Project status, current source code,
bugtracker etc. can be found on the `MPIFX project home page
<https://www.bitbucket.org/aradi/mpifx>`_.
