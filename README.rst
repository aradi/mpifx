MPIFX - Modern Fortran Interface for MPI
========================================

The open source library `MPIFX <https://github.com/dftbplus/mpifx>`_ is
an effort to provide modern Fortran (Fortran 2003) wrappers around
routines of the MPI library to make their use as simple as possible.

It currently contains only a few routines so far, but if those happen to be the
ones you need, feel free to use this project (MPIFX is licensed under the
**simplified BSD license**).

If your desired MPI routine is not yet wrapped up, feel free to contribute to
the project to include the target functionality.
